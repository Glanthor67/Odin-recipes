            <li>1 boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 175g)</li>
            <li>1 tsp chopped fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
            <li>50g rice or wheat noodles</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sweetcorn, canned or frozen</li>
            <li>2-3 mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 spring onions, shredded</li>
            <li>2 tsp soy sauce, plus extra for serving</li>
            <li>mint or basil leaves and a little shredded chilli (optional), to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Pour the stock into a pan and add the chicken breast, ginger and garlic. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat,
                 partly cover and simmer for 20 mins, until the chicken is tender.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put the chicken on a board and shred into bite-size pieces using a couple of forks. Return the chicken to the stock with the noodles,
                sweetcorn, mushrooms, spring onion and soy sauce. Simmer for 3-4 mins until the noodles are tender.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ladle into two bowls and scatter over the remaining spring onion, mint or basil leaves and chilli, if using. Serve with extra soy sauce.
